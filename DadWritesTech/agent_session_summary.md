# Agent Session Summary and To-Do List

This document summarizes the current status of the website development, outlines the issues encountered, and details the plan for resolution.

## Original Requirements:

1.  **Draft a new blog post:** Create a new blog post with specific title and content.
2.  **Redesign the website's look:** Apply a new visual style based on a provided `possible_style.css` file, which included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a "terminal-like" theme. This implied theme overrides for global components (Navbar, Footer) and specific page components (Homepage).
3.  **Move calculators to a a"Tools" page:** Relocate existing calculator components to a new dedicated page and ensure their functionality.

## Implemented Changes So Far:

*   **Blog Post:**
    *   Created `blog/2025-07-05-is-it-time-to-upgrade-your-home-wifi.md` with the specified content.
    *   Added `wifi` and `home-networking` tags to `blog/tags.yml`.
    *   Added a `<!-- truncate -->` marker to the new blog post.
*   **Website Redesign (Theme Overrides):**
    *   Extracted CSS from `possible_style.css` and placed it into `src/css/custom.css`.
    *   Modified `src/pages/index.tsx` to incorporate the new hero and content sections from the provided HTML, including React `useEffect` hooks for animations (glitch, floating icons, chaos cards).
    *   Swizzled and modified `src/theme/Navbar/index.js` to implement the custom terminal-style header.
    *   Swizzled and modified `src/theme/Footer/index.js` to implement the custom terminal-style footer.
    *   Swizzled `src/theme/Layout/index.js` and moved global elements (`grid-bg`, `scroll-indicator`) and the scroll progress JavaScript into it.
    *   Added `padding-top: var(--ifm-navbar-height)` to the `main` element in `src/theme/Layout/index.js` to account for the fixed header.
    *   Added `padding-top: var(--ifm-navbar-height)` to the `article` element in `src/theme/DocItem/Layout/index.js` for documentation pages.
    *   Added `--ifm-navbar-height: 60px;` to `src/css/custom.css` as a default.
    *   Swizzled `src/theme/TOCCollapsible/index.js` and re-implemented its internal logic to remove dependency on `@docusaurus/theme-common/Collapsible`.
*   **Calculators to Tools Page:**
    *   Created `src/pages/tools.tsx` and imported/rendered `AnnualMileageCalculator.js` and `ContractionTimer.js` within it.
    *   Updated the Navbar link for "Tools" to point to `/tools`.
    *   Deleted the old `annual-mileage-calculator.mdx` and `contraction-timer.mdx` files.

## Current Issues and Analysis:

1.  **Build Failure (`ValidationError: "blogSidebarCount" must be one of [ALL, number]`):**
    *   **Problem:** The `docusaurus.config.ts` file has an invalid value for `blogSidebarCount`. It was set to `'custom'`, but Docusaurus expects either `"ALL"` or a numerical value.
    *   **Impact:** This is currently preventing the project from building successfully.

2.  **`TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'clientHeight')`:**
    *   **Problem:** This error occurs during the build process, pointing to a bundled Docusaurus file related to the Table of Contents (TOC) within blog posts. It indicates that JavaScript is trying to access `clientHeight` of an element that is `null`.
    *   **Analysis:** Even after attempts to disable the blog sidebar TOC and re-implement `TOCCollapsible`, this error persists. This suggests:
        *   The TOC might still be attempting to render in some scenarios despite configuration changes.
        *   The `clientHeight` access might be happening in a part of the Docusaurus core that is not directly controlled by the swizzled components.
        *   It could be a timing issue where the JavaScript runs before the DOM element is fully available.

3.  **Homepage Background (White background on "DAD WRITES TECH" section):**
    *   **Problem:** The homepage hero section (`.hero`) still displays a white background despite CSS rules in `src/css/custom.css` attempting to set it to `var(--dark-bg)`.
    *   **Analysis:** This is likely a CSS specificity issue where another Docusaurus default style or a more specific rule is overriding our custom background.

4.  **Header Overlap (Main post area not completely visible):**
    *   **Problem:** Content on pages (especially blog posts) is still partially hidden under the fixed header.
    *   **Analysis:** While `padding-top` was added to `main` and `article` elements, it might not be sufficient or consistently applied across all content types. The `var(--ifm-navbar-height)` might not be resolving correctly or might not be enough.

## To-Do List:

1.  **Fix `docusaurus.config.ts` `blogSidebarCount` error (Priority 1 - Blocking Build):**
    *   **Action:** Modify `docusaurus.config.ts` to correctly disable the blog sidebar TOC. Set `blogSidebarTitle: undefined`, `blogSidebarCount: 0`, and `blogSidebarItems: []`.
    *   **Verification:** Run `npm run build`. If successful, proceed to the next step.

2.  **Re-evaluate TOC (`clientHeight` error) (Priority 2):**
    *   **Action:** After fixing the build, if the `clientHeight` error persists, it indicates the TOC is still attempting to render. I will need to investigate the Docusaurus rendering pipeline for blog posts more deeply. This might involve:
        *   Examining the `node_modules` for the `BlogPostPage` component (where the error originates) to understand how it integrates the TOC.
        *   As a last resort, if the TOC cannot be cleanly disabled or fixed, I might propose overriding the entire `BlogPostPage` component to remove the TOC rendering entirely.
    *   **Verification:** Visually inspect blog post pages after a successful build to confirm the TOC is not present and the error is gone.

3.  **Fix Homepage Background (Priority 3):**
    *   **Action:** Use browser developer tools to inspect the `.hero` element on the homepage and identify all applied CSS rules. Determine which rule is overriding `background: var(--dark-bg);`.
    *   **Action:** Adjust the CSS in `src/css/custom.css` to ensure the `background: var(--dark-bg);` rule has higher specificity (e.g., by adding a more specific selector or using `!important` if absolutely necessary, though this should be avoided if possible).
    *   **Verification:** Visually confirm the homepage hero section has the correct dark background.

4.  **Verify Header Overlap (Priority 4):**
    *   **Action:** Visually inspect various pages (homepage, blog posts, tools page, about page) to confirm that content is not hidden under the fixed header.
    *   **Action:** If overlap still occurs, adjust the `padding-top` value in `src/theme/Layout/index.js` and `src/theme/DocItem/Layout/index.js` as needed. Ensure that `var(--ifm-navbar-height)` is correctly resolving to a numerical value.
    *   **Verification:** Visually confirm no content is hidden under the header on any page.
