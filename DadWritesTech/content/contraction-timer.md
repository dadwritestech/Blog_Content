Use this tool to time your contractions. Click "**Start Contraction**" when one begins and "**Stop Contraction**" when it ends. The duration and frequency (time from the start of one to the start of the next) will be recorded below.

**Understanding History:**

* **By default:** The history list only remembers contractions recorded while this page is open in your browser (current session). If you close the tab or reload the page, the list will normally be empty again.
* **Saving History (Optional):** If you want to keep your history for your next visit, click the "**Save History**" button.
    * You will be asked to confirm.
    * If you confirm, the current list of contractions will be saved **only within your web browser's local storage** on this specific computer or device.
* **Loading Saved History:** When you return to this page later using the same browser, any previously saved history will be loaded automatically. A message "Loaded previously saved history" will appear briefly.
* **Clearing History:** Clicking the "**Clear History**" button will:
    * Ask for confirmation.
    * Clear the contractions currently listed on the page.
    * **Permanently delete** any history you had previously saved in your browser's storage for this tool.
* **Privacy:** The contraction data you record and optionally save is stored **only locally in your browser**. It is **never** sent over the internet or stored on any server.
