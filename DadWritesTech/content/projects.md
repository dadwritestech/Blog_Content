This space contains links to the projects I've dedicated some time to. It's like opening a window to my world of technical writing! It ain't perfect, but it's my own little treasure trove!

- [Markdown Practice](https://dbvamsi.github.io/markdown/) - A github Pages site holding some of my early days of Markdown practice.


- [API Documentation #1](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15482145/TzXtK1Pu) - Example documentation for smart Devices API.


- [API Documentation #2](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15482145/TzRLmqYY) - Example documentation for a Candy Store API.

- [Dad Writes Tech](https://www.dad-writes-tech.com/) - This is a pet project I wanted to do for a while now. It's finally live.
