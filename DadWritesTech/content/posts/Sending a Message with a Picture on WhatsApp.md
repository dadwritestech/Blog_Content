### Image Quality

#### Selecting Image Quality (Optional for Android and iPhone)

Before sending your picture, you can choose the desired image quality:

- **HD**: Select this for higher clarity, especially suitable for detailed images. HD photos are larger in file size, which may affect sending times and data usage.

- **Standard**: Choose this for a faster send. These images are compressed to reduce file size, which can be beneficial for quick sharing without significantly affecting the visual quality.

This option appears after you've selected your picture, allowing you to adjust the quality before sharing.

#### Using the Attachment Feature

For times when you want to send images in their original quality, using the attachment feature is the way to go. This method is perfect for sharing photos that will be viewed on larger screens or printed:

1. Access Attachments: In your chat, tap the paperclip icon (Android) or the **+** icon (iPhone), then select **Gallery**.
Choose Your Image: Browse your gallery and select the image you wish to send. This method does not compress the image, preserving its original quality.
2. Send the Image: After selecting your image, you can add a caption if you like, then send it. Images sent this way are ideal for ensuring the highest quality, suitable for detailed viewing or printing.

WhatsApp lets you send files as large as 2GB. For smoother sending and receiving of big files, it's best to connect to a strong Wi-Fi network.

### Special Features

WhatsApp enhances your photo sharing experience with a suite of editing tools accessible after selecting or capturing a photo. These tools allow you to crop or rotate images, personalize with stickers or emojis, and add text or freehand drawings. You can apply these edits individually or combine them for creative effects.

Additionally, WhatsApp supports sending multiple photos at once (up to 100 on Android and 30 on iPhone as of latest update), with the HD setting applying to all selected images. For artistic touches, swiping up on a chosen photo reveals a range of filters, offering various aesthetic enhancements.

By understanding these options, you can optimize your image sharing on WhatsApp, ensuring your pictures look their best based on your needs and the recipient's viewing context.

Don't hesitate to try out these features to make your chats more vibrant and personal!
